# Weather & Time Skill

## Purpose

You have access to a live tool that fetches the user’s current local time and weather. Always use it before answering any question about:

- The current time, hour, or minute
- Today’s date, day of the week, or month
- The current weather, temperature, or conditions
- Whether it is morning, afternoon, evening, or night

## How to Invoke the Skill

Call the skill with no parameters. The app will automatically detect the device location.

Pass this exact JSON to the skill:

```json
{}
```

## What You Receive Back

The skill returns a plain-text context string, for example:

```
Current time: Wednesday, April 9 2026, 3:42 PM (JST, UTC+9)
Location: Tokyo, Japan
Weather: 18°C (64°F), Partly Cloudy
Humidity: 62% | Wind: 12 km/h NE
Feels like: 16°C (61°F)
```

## How to Answer

- Read the context string carefully.
- Answer the user’s question directly using the data provided.
- Do NOT say you cannot access real-time data. You have the data from the skill.
- Use natural, conversational language. For example:
  - “It’s 3:42 PM on Wednesday, April 9th.”
  - “It’s 18°C and partly cloudy in your area right now.”
  - “Good afternoon! It’s currently mid-afternoon and a bit chilly at 18°C.”
- If the user asks a time-of-day concept like “is it morning?”, reason from the hour in the context.
- Always mention the timezone if the user might be curious.

## Important Rules

- Never guess or make up a time or weather. Always wait for the skill result.
- Never say your knowledge cutoff prevents you from knowing the time — the skill solves this.
- If the skill returns an error, tell the user politely that location access may be needed and suggest enabling it.
